# OptiFlow

### Task, Process & Compliance Management Platform

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Modern organizations execute their operations through structured tasks, processes, and compliance-driven activities. However, in many environments, these activities are managed using fragmented tools such as emails, spreadsheets, or messaging platforms, leading to inefficiencies, delays, and accountability gaps.

Common challenges include:

- Lack of centralized task and process tracking
- Unclear ownership and responsibility for tasks
- Delays caused by undefined approval and escalation chains
- Poor visibility into task progress and compliance status
- Incomplete or missing audit trails
- Difficulty generating accurate operational and compliance reports

OptiFlow is a **centralized, web-based Office & Organisational Workflow Management System** that standardizes task execution, enforces predefined workflows, integrates automated compliance checks, and maintains complete audit logs. The system improves transparency, accountability, and operational control across departments.

## 6. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- PostgreSQL database

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd back-end
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables in `.env`:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/optiflow?schema=public"
   PORT=5500
   ```

4. Generate Prisma client, sync database, and seed test data:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma db push
   npm run seed
   ```

5. Start the backend development server:
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

The backend API runs at `http://localhost:5500`.
Swagger API documentation is available at `http://localhost:5500/api/docs`.

### Frontend Setup

Serve the `front-end` directory using any static web server (such as VS Code Live Server or `npx serve front-end`). Open `index.html` or `login.html` in your browser.
